**Gulp -** install gulp using **npm install gulp -g**

#### 2. Set Up the Portal in local machine:

1. To set up the Sunbird application  **release 1.8**  , get the [code](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-portal.git) from the sunbird-portal Git repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local system using the command:

\*\*             git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-portal.git\*\*

\*\*             Note\*\* : Stable versions of the sunbird portal code are available via tags for each release. The master branch contains the latest stable release. To get the latest stable release of                                        Sunbird, [click here](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-portal/).

&#x20;    3\.  After executing the  **git clone**  command, run the following set of commands in the console:

```
 $ cd {PROJECT-FOLDER}/src/app
 $ npm install
```

&#x20; &#x20;

**3. Creating or Updating Resource bundles:**     go to following location in project  by running below command

```


                $ cd resourcebundles/data
```

&#x20;   here you can see two folders with names  \*\*formElements, messages \*\* each folder contains **.properties** files in different languages for example for \*\*English language \*\* it will be en.properties file

\*\*   Creating new resource bundle\*\*

&#x20;    to create new resource bundles in  **Telugu**  language, create a file with name \*\*te.properties \*\* and copy data from **en.properties** file to it.

&#x20;    and update the resource bundle values like below&#x20;

&#x20;  &#x20;

&#x20;          **en.properties** contains add=ADD and open **te.properties** file which is created earlier and

&#x20;          updated add=జోడించడానికి

\*\*  Updating existing resource bundle\*\*

&#x20;   to update existing resource bundles open that resource bundles and change the values as per your need

after creating or updating resource bundles run the following command from {PROJECT-FOLDER}/src/app location

&#x20;      $ gulp build-resource-bundles

it will generate the corresponding json files for each language  in  **{PROJECT-FOLDER}/src/app/resourcebundles/jsonHow to set a specific language as portal default language**

for example if we want to set telugu as portal default language we need to update&#x20;

\*\*sunbird\_portal\_default\_language \*\* environment variable to \*\*te \*\* and restart the service to see the changes
